# React Example

A simple full-stack todo app for demonstrating how React works with in-page `useEffect` fetches.

## Purpose

This project shows basic React patterns including:
- Component structure with pages and reusable components
- State management with `useState`
- Data fetching with `useEffect` (simple in-page fetch calls)
- Conditional rendering and loading states
- Form handling

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python (in-memory storage)

## Getting Started

Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
uv run python main.py
```

Start the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
